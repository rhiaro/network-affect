## Chapter 1

The planet turned, and the Houses of Sco turned with it, but the residents never witnessed the sun appear above the horizon. Nor did they see it dip below, to mark a day's end. The world lightened a little, then darkened a little, that was all.

The Houses of Sco were surrounded on all sides by vast tracts of land, almost entirely flat. A great many miles to the east, the land turned into marshes and then disappeared into salty ocean. To the west and north lay hills, then mountains. But very far away; no hills could be seen from the Houses of Sco, even on a clear day, even from the highest point on the highest rooftop.

South, that was a direction worth looking in. To the south, the land became pockmarked and cracked. From far above it appeared as the surface of a fragile thing, worn and flaking. Sometimes the thick air would hang more heavily over the south. Sometimes a plume of dark _something_, purplish or greenish or greyish, would billow upwards from just beyond the horizon, pouring into the atmosphere. Scattered in between the places where the land was worn away and sinking, great conical mounds rose up. They were always shifting. Some grew slowly, some quickly, and some crumbled or narrowed or went from tall and thin to short and squat over days or seasons or years.

Most mornings, Mustard would climb to the highest point on the highest rooftop of the Great House, and watch his sister-friend Sushi sketching the layout of the mounds. He didn't find the mounds themselves very interesting. But he was fascinated by the way Sushi could take that far away landscape and reel it in, pulling details from an impossible distance for examination under their very noses, with a few nimble strokes of a piece of charcoal. She could certainly see things that Mustard could not.

This morning, the sky was especially vibrant, and Sushi sketched that as well. Twisting, turmultuous shapes, layers upon layers, that could convince anyone that the sky went on far far further than the land. The clouds gave the impression of constant roiling movement, and yet as long a Mustard stared he could not see them shift. But if he looked away, down at Sushi's pale, charcoal stained fingers as they danced over her cardboard canvas, just for a few moments, and then back up, the skyscape would be completely changed. Sushi's drawings captured all of this, and more.

Whilst Sushi sketched, Mustard would speak to her of his dreams. Most nights their dreams overlapped, so she'd already know what he was going to say, but sometimes they'd each see things from a slightly different perspective, or have a different insight about the same occurance. When the sketch was finished, they would examine these differences keenly.

"I dreamt of crawling things," he told her on this morning. "We were the crawling things. We were ones among many, more than the people in Sco, more than the fingers on the hands of all the people in Sco, more than that even." He paused to see if she understood. Sushi never replied while she was drawing, but if Mustard mentioned something that didn't align with her experience her brows would wrinkle a little, her tiny nose would scrunch up.

Sushi was some years younger than Mustard, but he was very sure she was much smarter, as smart as an adult even. He sometimes struggled to find the words for the complicated things he experienced in dreams, but Sushi always understood, and knew the right words to explain it back to him perfectly.

Mustard could remember when she was born, just about. Everyone had been surprised to see a baby with such pale, almost transparent, skin and pink eyes coming out of such a dark featured mother. Mustard was darker still, so that if Sushi teased him by drawing on his arms with charcoal the patterns were almost invisble. But as they aged together, the similarities in their features became more apparent. They shared disproportionately large ears, dainty noses, and deceptively serious eyes. Their hair fell in the same way, straight, but wispy and unkempt, around their shoulders; only Mustard's was jet black, and Sushi's was pure white.

"We were allâ€¦ doing the same thing. We had to do the same thing. Everyone together working for the same thing. I couldn't talk to anyone around me, but I could feel it, I knew it, even though nobody talked." Mustard frowned, trying to remember what the the thing was, exactly.

Sushi put the finishing touches to the final clouds in her sketch with a flick of her wrist. She captured some as they were reaching as long, gnarled fingers to claw at the earth. The mounds beneath them were narrow and twisted, almost a mirror image, reaching back up to the sky.

"We shared a purpose," she said, rubbing her blackened fingers ineffectually against her coarse tunic. So much charcoal stained the tunic already that it made no difference, either to clothes or hands. "We were united with a goal."

Mustard nodded. Like when they were on the same team in a game of Pasto. "Did you understand what the goal was? I can't remember."

Sushi shook her head. "It was important," she said.
