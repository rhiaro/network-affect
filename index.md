# Network Affect

## (Mustard)

The planet turned, and the Houses of Sco turned with it, but the residents never witnessed the sun appear above the horizon. Nor did they see it dip below, to mark a day's end. The world lightened a little, then darkened a little, that was all.

The Houses of Sco were surrounded on all sides by vast tracts of land, almost entirely flat. A great many miles to the east, the land turned into marshes and then disappeared into salty ocean. To the west and north lay hills, then mountains. But very far away; no hills could be seen from the Houses of Sco, even on a clear day, even from the highest point on the highest rooftop.

South, that was a direction worth looking in. To the south, the land became pockmarked and cracked. From far above it appeared as the surface of a fragile thing, worn and flaking. Sometimes the thick air would hang more heavily over the south. Sometimes a plume of dark _something_, purplish or greenish or greyish, would billow upwards from just beyond the horizon, pouring into the atmosphere. Scattered in between the places where the land was worn away and sinking, great conical mounds rose up. They were always shifting. Some grew slowly, some quickly, and some crumbled or narrowed or went from tall and thin to short and squat over days or seasons or years.

Most mornings, Mustard would climb to the highest point on the highest rooftop of the Great House, and watch his sister-friend Sushi sketching the layout of the mounds. He didn't find the mounds themselves very interesting. But he was fascinated by the way Sushi could take that far away landscape and reel it in, pulling details from an impossible distance for examination under their very noses, with a few nimble strokes of a piece of charcoal. She could certainly see things that Mustard could not.

This morning, the sky was especially vibrant, and Sushi sketched that as well. Twisting, turmultuous shapes, layers upon layers, that could convince anyone that the sky went on far far further than the land. The clouds gave the impression of constant roiling movement, and yet as long a Mustard stared he could not see them shift. But if he looked away, down at Sushi's pale, charcoal stained fingers as they danced over her cardboard canvas, just for a few moments, and then back up, the skyscape would be completely changed. Sushi's drawings captured all of this, and more.

Whilst Sushi sketched, Mustard would speak to her of his dreams. Most nights their dreams overlapped, so she'd already know what he was going to say, but sometimes they'd each see things from a slightly different perspective, or have a different insight about the same occurance. When the sketch was finished, they would examine these differences keenly.

"I dreamt of crawling things," he told her on this morning. "We were the crawling things. We were ones among many, more than the people in Sco, more than the fingers on the hands of all the people in Sco, more than that even." He paused to see if she understood. Sushi never replied while she was drawing, but if Mustard mentioned something that didn't align with her experience her brows would wrinkle a little, her tiny nose would scrunch up.

Sushi was some years younger than Mustard, but he was very sure she was much smarter, as smart as an adult even. He sometimes struggled to find the words for the complicated things he experienced in dreams, but Sushi always understood, and knew the right words to explain it back to him perfectly.

Mustard could remember when she was born, just about. Everyone had been surprised to see a baby with such pale, almost transparent, skin and pink eyes coming out of such a dark featured mother. Mustard was darker still, so that if Sushi teased him by drawing on his arms with charcoal the patterns were almost invisble. But as they aged together, the similarities in their features became more apparent. They shared disproportionately large ears, dainty noses, and deceptively serious eyes. Their hair fell in the same way, straight, but wispy and unkempt, around their shoulders; only Mustard's was jet black, and Sushi's was pure white.

"We were allâ€¦ doing the same thing. We had to do the same thing. Everyone together working for the same thing. I couldn't talk to anyone around me, but I could feel it, I knew it, even though nobody talked." Mustard frowned, trying to remember what the the thing was, exactly.

Sushi put the finishing touches to the final clouds in her sketch with a flick of her wrist. She captured some as they were reaching as long, gnarled fingers to claw at the earth. The mounds beneath them were narrow and twisted, almost a mirror image, reaching back up to the sky.

"We shared a purpose," she said, rubbing her blackened fingers ineffectually against her coarse tunic. So much charcoal stained the tunic already that it made no difference, either to clothes or hands. "We were united with a goal."

Mustard nodded. Like when they were on the same team in a game of Pasto. "Did you understand what the goal was? I can't remember."

Sushi shook her head. "It was important," she said.

* * *

The door to the rooftop was solid and heavy, but it also only just barely hung on by one rusty hinge. The frame was warped so it could never properly close. People as small as Mustard and Sushi could slip through the gap without even having to move it.

They stepped softly as ever in socked feet, but the sparse metal stairwell clanged and rattled as they descended nonetheless.

They left the stairs at the Top Floor, a mezzanine level in the rafters of the Great House. Early as it was, someone was already at work there. A hulking man named Kombu moved stacks of fresh pulp for cardboard from a loading shaft into a storage corner. This was where Sushi pilfered her drawing canvases from. Kombu's dark eyes and heavy brow made him seem surly, but his face cracked into a smile when he saw the two youngsters crossing the floor.

"Braw morning eh, you two?" His speech was slow and his voice deep. "How are things looking _out there_?"

"Same as ever, different as ever," Mustard grinned back. The pair trotted to a drop shaft. A series of thick ropes tied into loops for feet and knots for handholds formed part of a pulley system that allowed them to descend the rest of the way. It was a long way to the ground, and the rope they clung to trundled slowly down.

"Kombu is never on the rooftop," said Sushi as they dropped. "He always asks us how it is, but he never goes to see himself."

Mustard shrugged. "I don't think he really wants to know."

Most of the adults in Sco seemed to think Mustard and Sushi would grow out of their fascination with the view of _beyond_. Apparently everyone did.

But some adults travelled. There was another Great House, a day's train ride away. Mustard and Sushi's parent, Lemonade, would be on her way back from there today or tomorrow, making her fifth trip. One for each child. Every few years one or two people would go, although they didn't always come back. But when they did, a new baby would be born from them soon after.

In Sco, those who bore the children had no more or less involvement in raising them as all of the other adults. But before each journey, Lemonade made a point of taking her youngest aside and promised them she would return. Most recently, that had been Sushi.

On the Ground Floor, they passed briefly along the edge of the main interior of the Great House. It was an enormous space, stretching out farther than the eye could see, and contained row upon row of shelving units that reached up almost to the height of the Top Floor.

Outside, the air was humid. The ground was hard and black and as flat between the Houses as it was in the surrounding lands. Someone had built a miniature diorama of the southern conical mounds by stacking stones and small chunks of rock and other debris. The clouds overhead had evened out into a smooth mass with no depth whatsoever, and glowed the usual brownish orange of the morning.

Mustard and Sushi joined a growing crowd of people their own age who were waiting for their first meal of the day outside of the Eating House. When their turn came, they each reached a cup into a large vat of stinking green-brown _nutri_ sludge.

"Thick today," said Mustard. Often they could drink it straight down, but this morning a spoon was required.

"They added beans," Sushi observed, lifting a spoonful and watching stretchy gelatinous tendrils snap one by one from the mass in the cup. "I like it," she added, around a mouthful.

The stuff wasn't heated, but was warm from its own fermentation. The vats of _nutri_ were largely left alone and never ran empty. Foods from around the Great House were added periodically to keep the stuff alive.

Fifteen children sat in a rough circle and ate or smeared their _nutri_. These were the early risers. Another two or three shifts would come later in the morning. Sushi was the youngest, and Mustard the third oldest. They sat outside the Eating House, rather than inside, as it was warmer out, and they all sensed that rain would come soon and that usually lasted for many days at a time. The rain was always heavy; there would be no sitting outside once it started.

"Do you know the train schedule yet?" asked Butter, a skinny boy with a medium brown complexion close to Mustard's age.

Mustard frowned.

## (Bird)

Bird had lived in the Turing Loop of the Nubo Station for her whole life, but she still found herself getting lost between levels five and seven. All the levels in the Education District looked alike: white panelled walls, soft encouragingly green floors, and door after sliding door of study and seminar rooms. The rooms were named, instead of numbered, which was nice because they were a continuous reminder of the great minds throughout history without whom the Nubo Station would not have existed; thanks due to every discipline imaginable. But for those who had not made a study of these people and their works and their relationships to each other - as Bird had not - and whose scheduler continually failed to include junction coordinates with the meeting location - as Bird's always did - it was less than a convenient system.

Bird rounded a curve into a corridor identical to the last, and pawed at the _Fonu_ display clipped loosely to the underside of her forearm. The small panel beside the door of the room closest to her said, in the three most common scripts of Nubo Station, _Webber_. The problem - another problem - was that the system maps for each level all looked identical too. She had this class in the _Prodromou_ room four times a semester, which was not quite frequently enough for her to have built any kind of muscle memory for getting there.

A schedule alert blinked urgently from the bottom corner of her display. She was almost forty [millieads] late. One third of the time allotted. She flicked her wrist to dismiss it. Then passed her hand in front of the _Webber_ room panel to scan the room code. The Fonu reacted, projecting a three dimensional map of the Education District in the air in front of her face with the _Webber_ room highlighted. She had been one level out in her frantic search of the 2D map moments ago. That's why she couldn't find _Prodromou_ on it. It was a small consolation that she had remembered right after all, and the room she needed was just a few doors down. _They should really make the name panels bigger so we can read them from further away_, she thought, not for the first time, as she marched the final stretch.

The door opened silently as she approached. Her entrance was into the front of the room, but her peers were focused on their own Fonu displays, and none acknowledged her lateness. The room was a small and comfortable one, with some boxy elevated seating around the outside edge, covered with the same material as the floor, but most students sat on the soft white cushions scattered around the floor in the center. Bird took one of these; the closest unoccupied one was right by the door. For a moment she wondered if her classmates had left it free on purpose, in anticipation of her eventual arrival. But of course they had not. She had been late to every single seminar in this room to date, but everyone must have enough of their own concerns to not remember the details of Bird's personal scheduling malfunctions.

The class - an elective on preservation of ancient life forms - was being taught by a projection of a gravitics maintenance engineer who happened to be an expert amateur in the subject. The tutor was a somewhat elderly redhead, pale, freckled, with bony fingers that traced patterns in the air as she talked, named Maple. The three dimensional projection didn't carry colour all that well, but Bird had been in the same room as Maple once, for the first class in the series (albeit late). Maple had subsequently come down with some kind of respiratory infection, recovering before the next class, but refusing to meet with students other than through the holoprof network ever since. Bird couldn't blame her.

Bird synced her Fonu with the room, and was soon immersed in an overview of the various permineralisation processes and what they can tell present day researchers about the natural environment on the planet below tens of thousands to millions to billions of years ago.

Or they would, if such researchers existed. Bird was lucky, she knew, that she was able to take this class at all. The circle in charge of curriculum for the Education District clung tightly to their early established aims around keeping all study paths open for all citizens, citing the frequent historical occasions where an obscure breakthrough in a fringe discipline had taken some society or other in an unprecedented direction. But as the Nubo Station expanded - a fourth offshoot was being built, in a slightly lower orbit than the Turing Loop - there were an increasing number of voices who argued that these aims were in conflict with ensuring the population's most pressing needs were met.

Somewhere deep down, Bird had a feeling that a broad education and diversity of study was really an important thing, though if someone asked her in the context of Station politics she might have said she didn't have a strong opinion either way. But this subconscious resolve might explain why she spent most of her spare time taking classes in a plethora of apparently unrelated subject areas.

One advantage of the holoprof was that Bird could switch the language the class was being taught in. Most people raised in the Turing Loop could understand the two official languages fluently, and were familiar with the third most common at least to read, but Bird's first language was none of these. Her family pod had mostly belonged to what most people called a 'minority heritage', so a fourth, more rarely spoken language had been impressed into her neural pathways during her childhood. It was gentler on her brain, simpler, refreshing to listen to. The Fonu and holoprof interfaced with each other and Bird activated the audio input burls behind her earlobes, and suddenly Maple seemed to be speaking the language Bird had been raised with quite naturally. This was much easier for her to pay attention to.

Maple paused her monologue and looked around at what she could see of the class. She would have been observing her students on a large, curved wall display in a presentation room designed precisely for the case of an individual addressing a large group. Station coordinators used them all the time to report on policy or operational matters to the wider population. But the resolution was not high for the speaker, and the viewing angle was imperfect, so it wasn't really close to as good as being in the same room for interaction and feedback.

Of course Maple's Fonu also registered which students had synchronised their own devices to the class materials. She couldn't see what they were looking at, but their presence was noted and she could send them individual private pings if she needed to.

In lieu of a good read on body language in the room, with the aid of her Fonu, Maple began a round. She pinged each student in turn, and queued up the next so they would be prepared a few moments in advance.

"How have you found what we have discussed so far? Are there any areas you need clarification?"

A couple of students voiced questions. Most said they had none. Maple noted them to answer together at the end.

Bird's turn came about half way through the round. "Nothing from me," she said, and registered the widening eyes on the holographic face. She switched languages. "Sorry," she said, and repeated herself in standard hispana.

Maple called on the next student, and nobody in the room so much as looked up. Bird felt embarrassed all the same.

* * *

Bird left the class feeling drained.

When she had picked out this seminar series to attend, she had been absolutely steadfastly fascinated by all of the old things that might be preserved on the planet below that they would be able to get to and examine once the toxic fog cleared. At some point in the last year she had read or heard something that had convinced her at a spiritual level that looking to the past was essential for preparing for the future. But now she was daunted by the sheer volume of history there was to examine. There couldn't possibly be enough people and enough years to even begin to piece it all together.

There were two classes left. It was just an introduction, after all. She could choose whether or not she wanted deeper study in the area later on. Bird would see them through, and do the self-study exercises, grimly determined that her enthusiasm might reappear at some point. Besides, if she gave up early her _completer_ points would take more of a hit than she was really comfortable with.

Bird had work to do. She cleaned components for the air filtration systems on the station. It didn't matter when she did it, as long as there were enough clean parts for assemblers to fit back in, and the canister of used ones wasn't overflowing.

She should learn now the air filtration works, she thought, as she walked through the muted corridors of the Education District. That seems important. Probably more useful than fossils. Perhaps she ought to do engineer training after all.

But first she ought to head back and clean some fenestraÄµo.

Her wrist tensed at a light vibration from her Fonu. Without slowing her pace, she rotated her arm to look at the display. Someone was buzzing her home pod. It would definitely be one of her guardians. Probably Lamb. They were the only member of Bird's family pod who always neglected to send a message before dropping round in person.

Bird reached an internal shuttle hatch that would take her out of the Education District. Her Fonu interfaced with it at once and requested a destination. In one direction was the Residential District. Spending the rest of the day shoving a brush around little metal gadgets from her pod had not seemed unappealing, until a potential argument with Lamb had been thrown into the mix.

She chose the option for the Commercial District, also known as the Dome.

Moments later, the door swished open and she stepped into a large capsule like vehicle. There were few others inside at this time, but it wasn't uncommon to find the shuttles packed full. Bird briefly appreciated not being squashed against the curved glass side and forced to acknowledge the height or speed at which she was travelling.

Moments later, she was stepping out of the chute in the Dome.

Bird didn't come down to the Commercial District often, and what was available there seemed to be changing all the time. The group tasked with running the place were always in the stationwide reports, members joining and leaving, but she paid little attention. She turned into a relatively busy passage lined on both sides with holoshops where display screens reflected back images of anyone who paused long enough in one spot, visualising their own personal model of the goods available, and then awaiting input from their Fonu for customisations. All of this could be done from home pods too of course, and it was a relatively recent development that getting the stuff people needed became something they'd go out to do socially. Long enough that many had forgotten it was ever otherwise, but recently enough that Bird could remember feeling a change. A few years ago she had thought to contribute to this sector.

"Hey," a voice near her head, addressing someone else. "Hello, it's Bird isn't it?" No, addressing her. She stopped abruptly, her shoulders brushed on both sides by people still moving. A short-haired, hazel-eyed face had stopped beside her, an expectant look in their eyes. Familiar. "I was in Maple's class just now," they explained. "I'm Gull."

"Oh, hi." Said Bird . "I didn't think anyone knew me in there."

"Sorry," Gull looked timid. "I noticed the roster update when you synced and I think our names are semantically related? So I thought maybe you were from Coast Sector as well."

Bird shook her head. "I was named in Sky." She hadn't grown up there, but it didn't occur to her to volunteer more information.

"Sorry," Gull said again. They were a little shorter than Bird, which was unusual as Bird was below average high for the Turing Loop herself. "I didn't mean to delay you. Are you late for something else?"

"Something else," Bird murmured.

Gull's eyes widened again. "Sorry, I didn't mean..."

Bird smiled, feeling a little pity. "No, not late. No plans." She hesitated a moment longer, then sighed. "Do you know any good places on Commercial?"

Gull brightened at once. "Good places for what? There's a great place for abbiodilla cake down on two. Or for fizz on four."

"Somewhere not so busy," said Bird. "And that feels cosy."

"I think I know one." Gull beamed. "I'll show you."

Gull led Bird through the bustling groups of shoppers. Gull walked fast, and Bird had to push a little beyond her usual pace to keep up. Over a dark grey practical jumpsuit that was almost the same as the one Bird wore, Gull had a sleek backpack.

They followed the curve around, then went into a chute to go up two levels. It was quieter here. They were closer to the outside of the Dome, Bird could feel it. The shop fronts displayed practical things, gadgetry, tools for repairing appliances in a home pod, or for modifying a Fonu, or some things she didn't recognise at all. "Here," Gull stopped outside of an arched doorway labelled 'Cake'. An appealing prospect.

The place was dim and cosy. Enclosed by thin walls in shades of brown and burnt orange, 'Cake' was in a controversial position against the very edge of the Dome. Instead of walling off the sheer transparent plexi like many places on the outer ring, they had embraced their location and foregone artificial light in favour of the mottled natural light that seeped in from _beyond_.  Gull paused to ask Bird where she would like to sit. Bird took it for granted that Gull would be joining her, and pointed to a seat by this window to the outside world. The seats were comfortable, sinking velvety armchairs.

The menu appeared on her forearm with a chirrup. She ignored it, and leaned forward to stare at the eddies of dark sand that swirled _beyond_. For the past ten years, the Commercial District had found itself peeking out above a  storm of whirling debris, just loose enough to allow threads of pure sunlight through the sides. Today the light was tinted to darker shades by the raging sand and dust, and cast ever moving patterns across the walls in 'Cake'. Someone smart had designed the decor to complement this. She pressed her fingers on the plexi. It all seemed so close, the chaos. Inches away from her face. But there were metres and metres of material between Bird and _beyond_.

_How did we live out there?_  She wondered.

Gull was browsing the menu. Bird watched for a moment, then decided to do the same. She suddenly felt a need for something warm and comforting. Most places had a fairly standard selection of items to cover nutritional needs, but 'Cake' seemed to have applied the logic of customisations that one usually found for clothes, to consumables.

She tapped through flavour and texture combinations, deciding vaguely that she wanted a liquid; something thick and foamy. Perhaps a hint of mint layered with rich, smoky, chocolate-esque tones. She moved a slider to increase the size of her drink, and hovered her finger over the selection confirmation button (labelled, jovially, as "Yes please!"). She hesitated, realising she had left the _colour_ unset. It would probably come out matching the decor, and at that moment she wanted something to counteract the shades of the angrily swirling _beyond_. She moved the hue slider around, and settled on a warm, deep pink.

Bird placed her order. A few moments later, a matt grey disk in the centre of the table in front of her began to hum softly.  She leaned forwards in anticipation, tapping her fingers against the perspex that made up the rest of the table. A loading bar appeared over the menu on her wrist display to indicate the progress of her drink. Bird noticed that when she wasn't focusing on it, the table seemed to disappear, transparent as it was, catching and refracting the moving shadow patterns that poured in through the side of the Dome, from _beyond_.

A cube with edges of white light appeared, suspended over the disk in the centre. It began fill from the bottom, turning the rich pink Bird had chosen. She leaned forwards further and unconsciously licked her lips. She could see tiny bubbles. Her Fonu beeped to get her attention and she was prompted to choose a holder for her liquid from a selection of four. She tapped the icon for a tall holder, cylindrical and transparent. The beaker appeared as the white edges of the cube vanished, and the pink liquid sloshed down into the container.

Gull was watching bird with a look of gentle amusement. In front of them, their drink was beginning to fill as well. A translucent yellow green liquid splashed into a round tumbler. Gull picked it up and held it out.

"Gojon," they said. Bird smiled back and raised her own glass.

"Thanks for bringing me here," she said, taking a sip of her drink. "Mm! This is so... soft."

"So, do you have a conflict with the preservation of ancient life class?" Asked Gull. "Something else beforehand?"

"I just get lost," said Bird. "Somehow. Every single time. Everywhere in Education looks the same."

"But your Fonu tells you where you are?"

"Mine doesn't. I don't sync it with the Station except when I really have to. So it's not tracking where I am."

Gull nodded, like they understood, and sipped their drink.

## (Bird)

"Sure, you're a preservationist when it suits you!" An angry voice rang down the corridor, reverberating off stark metal wall panels. "But as soon as it's a little bit inconvenient for you personally, different rules apply! Exceptions can be made!"

Bird rounded the curve to see her two closest friends, Chinchilla and Coral, bickering as usual. Coral had a dark look, and he was glaring at Chinchilla's back as Chinchilla stalked away.

Bird opened her mouth to greet them both, but Chinchilla turned back, gesticulating wildly.

"You KNOW it's not that simple!" She cried, exasperated. "There are always tradeoffs, there's only so much we can do as individuals!"

"That I don't dispute," Coral stood with arms tightly folded against his narrow chest. "What I take issue with is your hypocrisy. You expect a different standard from everyone else. You make a big deal about taking all the right classes and eating all the right foods, but if you happen to draw *your* line in a different place than someone else then woe betide the poor soul who came to a different conclusion about the 'so much' they can do."

"You're missing the point. It's just not *practical* to..."

"Hey Bird," Coral inclined his head.

Chinchilla stopped mid rant as Bird sidled up to them. Chinchilla was tall, above average height, with broad shoulders and a mane of coarse black hair that contrasted sharply with pale skin and light blue eyes. She towered over Coral, hands buried in the hair at the back of her head, she pulled at it in frustration. Coral's hair was black as well, but straight and shiny. The sides of his head were shaved, and he wore it pulled into a neat half-bun on the top of his head. Coral seemed calm in comparison to Chinchilla, his voice always low, sharp features and small dark eyes giving a particular impression of focus. But Bird knew him well enough to sense that he was fuming.

"Arguing about beasties on the station?" She guessed.

"What else," sighed Coral. "Come on."

Bird followed Coral down the metal corridor, and Chinchilla followed a short distance behind. Bird wanted to ask what had set them off this time, but thought better of it.

Coral waved his hand in front of a wide door, inset into the metal walls. The door registered Coral's Fonu and raised upwards with a hiss.

Coral led Bird and Chinchilli into the mycolabs. It had been dark for a moment on the other side of that door, but the light level rose gently as their presence was detected. A walkway was illuminated softly ahead of them from either side at ankle height. Unlike the service corridor they had just passed through, the floor underfoot felt padded, and their steps made almost no sound. It wasn't fabricy and soft like in the Education and Commercial Districts, but had a comfortable give as they walked.

The angle of the lights meant that the walls were visible only up to about their waist heights, and disappeared into darkness above. They couldn't see the ceiling, and could see little up ahead as the corridor - like most on the Station - turned a curve.

Coral was bringing Bird to the mycolabs for the first time. He wanted to persuade her to transfer to a function there, not least so that they would see more of each other. But so far this tour was revealing very little.

"Is it always this dark?" Bird whispered. "And deserted?"

Coral replied at a normal volume. "We're just passing the incubation rooms. Here." He lifted his right hand and touched an outstretched finger to the wall beside him. A large window was immediately outlined in blue light. Bird could see the slight changes in texture and reflectivity that told her at once it was a transparent panel. The light was just enough to reveal a few shapes immediately on the other side. Shelves, or tables, she couldn't be sure.

"There are only people in here when it's time for changeover."

"Don't you worry that we depend on the mycolabs too much?" Chinchilla muttered to Bird. Her volume suggested she didn't want Coral to hear the question, though in the complete stillness of the place there was no way he would not.

Bird shrugged. "I don't see that we have a lot of options." She whispered still.

"It's just such a single point of failure. And taking us even further from our origins. We should be diversifying how we produce things. Looking back to old methods."

Coral chose to ignore her. Chinchilla had held functions in the mycolabs in the past, and was familiar with the place. Bird's sense of awe was more interesting to him. It was quite different here from the rest of the Turing Loop. Always fun to bring someone to visit for the first time.

It wasn't strictly out of bounds to bring in people who weren't registered to provide a function in the labs, but it wasn't very common either. As with most functions on Nubo, the work was flexible and people came and went when it suited them, but Coral had over long years worked out the indicators of the quietest times in the labs, and scheduled this visit accordingly. He didn't like to draw undue attention, but it also benefited his colleagues not to have strangers looking over their shoulders while they worked.

"I can't take you into the growing rooms." They could see more light up ahead, spilling out of windows on either side of the passage. "Well I could but we'd have to get all suited up and it's not really worth the trouble. But you'll like this. Even Chinchilla likes this. We have a whole little museum in the break room."

Coral talked Bird through a display of items in a series of transparent cabinets. The room where mycolab functionaries rested and made themselves hot drinks of instant _thurm_ was large by Station standards. It contained comfortable floor cushions, similar to those in the Education District, and was furnished in tones of soft pinks and browns. It felt earthy, Bird thought upon entering, without even realy knowing what that term meant.

The display ran along the longest curved wall, farthest from the door. Chinchilla made herself a drink and took a seat nearby, having seen all of the artefacts many times before.

The oldest item was a piece of a preserved tree bark, complete with remains of the armillaria that had killed it; a hundred year old tree, consumed by a thousand year old fungus, about two thousand years ago, measured by planet time. Bird gawked. "How did they _get_ that!"

The first fungal computer circuit was there, as well as an example of one of the earliest designs for adaptive self-repairing fabric. Apart from the ancient bark, everything on display was from the past five centuries, after the great cascade falure that had resulted in the planet being ultimately unable to sustain life had begin. Humans had lived down there, in degrees of chaos, for a full hundred years before managing to work out how to survive in the middle atmosphere, above the wreck of the planet and its churning skies. Much was lost during that time, and during the century following in the frantic scrabble to vacate the surface.

As children they had done an exercise to imagine what living on a planet was like. To walk and walk and never reach the end. To live directly out in space, with no enclosure at all. To share a home with _billions_ of other humans and uncountable numbers of non-humans too. It seemed like it would be cramped and busy, compared to life on the Station.

Bird had always wondered what it would be like to feel the planet rotate underneath herself. She imagined staggering and struggling for balance as the ground beneath her tipped gently towards the sun every morning. How did it compare with the soft, barely detectable but ever-present vibrations that surrounded them on Nubo Station?

"It's not ethical, that's all." Chinchilla and Coral were arguing again, seated in a corner while Bird read every single display label in the 'museum'. "All living things take up air, water, they have to eat. Our processing plants can barely keep up with the _human_ population. There's no purpose to introducing new species."

"That's what I just don't get," signed Coral. "The _purpose_ is to recreate the environment planetside of the past. So that when they clean it all up-"

"Hah! Clean it all up. When do you think that will be? Not in the lifetime of any of the beasties they're producing. Meanwhile we're hearing about reductions in the nutritional value of our food-"

"_Negligible_ reductions."

"-more days every cycle in power reduction mode, and a shorter recycle rhythm for pretty much all nonessentials. _That_ is a preservationist nightmare if you ask me."

"Depends what you're trying to preserve I suppose, doesn't it! We all know what this comes down to. You hav ea bunch of junk in your pod and you don't want to let it go."

"That's _not_ true."

"And yet I've lost count of the times I've seen you sneer at people who only speak two languages and use their Fonu for translations, as if everyone could just magic themselves into a quadrilingual family pod for their childhoods. And don't tell me they can learn when they're older." Coral looked ready to pounce. "Some people just choose to study other things! Even forward looking things! And that's okay!"

"This is not the point. The beasties, they don't even know if they're really like animals that existed on the planet before. They don't even know! It's not preservation, it's total creation."

"That's nonsense and you know it. There is so much historical and biological research - anyway, this _is_ the point. The point is that you're a hypocrite. Preservationism is such a huge and complexi thing and everyone brings their own perspective, their own contribution, and they're all imperfect, but they're not nothing, but you'll go off at anyone who isn't following exactly your prescribed model, doing just what you do. you treat it like a competition, but you get to pick and choose the rules, and objectively you're not even that good at it."

Coral was out of breath. Chinchilla swore quietly in a Pigin language, but didn't respond. She was indignant. Not used to being challenged so fiercely, she took a few minutes to re-collect herself.

Bird sat down between them. "Coral, will you show me how the _thurm_ machine works?"

Coral obliged. He was visibly more tired than he had looked when they came in. The pair had been arguing in Espa, the most widely spoken language on the Station, but Coral's family tongue was Putongh', the second most common. They were very different languages, and though, like most residents of the Turing Loop, Coral had essentially been raised trilingual it still took more out of him to speak Espa than either of the others.

When Bird and Coral reseated themselves with steaming mugs in hand, Chinchilla was messing with her Fonu. She had a three dimensional projection of some kind of construction in the air above her wrist, and she manipulated it using gestures with her right hand. She seemed absorbed.

"So what do you think? Nicer than sitting in your pod all the time?" Coral asked.

"I guess," Bird was noncommittal. "If they'll have me."

"Of course they'll have you, you're more than qualified."

"You've got such a high breadth score from being unable to stick to any one thing you can get a foot in any door at this point," Chinchilla put in.

"'Chilla!" Coral exclaimed. "Fucking hell. You're mad at me, not Bird."

Bird waved her hand as if to brush the comment aside. "I do think it's important to get a wide range of experience as a foundation," she said, though not as insistently as she might have a year ago. "But you're right 'Chilla, I should probably focus on something."

Chinchilla looked smug, and took a sip of her drink. "And myco is where you're going to do that?" Eyebrows raised.

"Well," Bird shrugged again. "I'll see how it goes."

Chinchilla shot Coral a look that told him not to expect Bird to stick around for long. Bird pretended not to see. She had tried the dedicated deep focus approach once, years ago. Perhaps now she was older and wiser it would go better. Coral had known her then, watched her go all in, combine free study and Station function and even friendships into one tangled and intractable mess, devote her whole being to a single pursuit, and then completely unravel when it all became too much. He had been there, borne witness, and picked her up in the aftermath. But perhaps had never fully understood how badly the experience had affected Bird. It was certainly not something she intended to repeat.

Nor did she feel like recapping the experience for Chinchilla, whom she had met towards the end of her burnout, and not really connected with until a few years later.

The break room door hissed open, and a stocky dark-skinned man walked in. His face was young and boyish, but his tightly curled hair was grey all over.

"Hey Moss," Coral waved across the room.

"Coral," the man replied. "And friends?" He made himself a drink and walked over to join them at their table.

"Friends, this is Moss," said Coral. "Moss, meet Chinchilla and Bird. I think you might have run into Chinchilla before."

"I remember you," said Chinchilla. "We overlapped here by a few months I think."

Moss smiled warmly. His voice had a strange lilt, an accent Bird couldn't quite place. "Quite possibly, quite possibly," he said. "I'm no good with faces, but your name sounds familiar."

"Managed to hack the Station yet?" Said Chinchilla, grinning. "That's what I remember about you. Always looking for new ways to interface your Fonu."

"Unfortunately not." Moss shrugged. "Options for accessible interfaces remain shockingly limited."

"Bird is as disconnected as you can get," Chinchilla pressed on. "Maybe she can help."

"Oh?" Moss looked genuinely interested. Which was not common.

"I use _sequin_ as a base operating system," she said, to test the water. Moss's eyes did not immediately glaze over. "And a separate interface application for pretty much every essential Station facility. All stripped down as far as possible. No automatic connections, and log erase signals sent out after every interaction is done."

"That's not reliable," said Moss. "Nubo is logging everything no matter what you ask it to do."

"Some things I'm sure. And it does mean most of my interfacing takes a bit longer than what a lot of people expect. Some things aren't as smooth. But overall I think it works pretty well."

Bird felt like Moss was weighing her up. Deciding how far to take the conversation.

"Unfortunately even that level of customisation is not available to me," he said finally. "I need enhanced audio interfacing to catch everything and only the Core Set of interface applications interoperate properly with the Station endpoints."

"So your Fonu is replaying everything we're saying right now into your ear burls?" Chinchilla put in.

"Not quite. The microphone on th eFonu isn't good enough to pic up anything outside of a really short range, and to filter ambient sounds to boot. It all has to go through Nubo."

Bird cringed. Of course she knew that the Station was peppered with sensing devices of all kinds. How could it not be to effectively support the population? But the reminder that it could replay to an individual directly was a reminder that it could do the same to someone in another room, or even another Loop, and a further reminder that it could record and store every conversation everywhere too.
