# Network Affect

## 2022-08-03

The story is two timelines but we don't know that until the end.

Bird - on some sort of futuristic orbital thing - is actually in the past. Thousands of years. Mustard and Sushi are on a planet that is beginning to rejuvenate itself, finally.

In Bird's thread, the prevailing belief is that humanity escaped, just, after fucking up the planet, a couple of hundred years ago, and that it's going to recover any day now. In this generation in fact. Things seem equitable and benevolent, but actually there's an insidious control over the population.

And, surprise, the planet is actually getting more fucked.

Somehow Bird comes to find the truth.

The enormous ancient fungal networks in Mustard and Sushi's time are a result of whatever Bird did in the past. Maybe Bird is part of this network even.

Something about the myco-food eaten by Bird's people. Used for control, but also as part of the solution.

Is there a secret evil cabal behind it all, or is the society running on a naive auto?

Lichens!! Fusion of beings, extremophiles, horizontal gene transfer..
